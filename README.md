- If you have [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/) compiler installed and configured:

```

```


## Usage

### Basic Usage

It's fairly simple, go-dork can be run with:

```bash
> go-dork -q "inurl:'...'"
```

### Flags

```bash
> go-dork -h
```

This will display help for the tool. Here are all the switches it supports.

| Flag           | Description                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| -q/--query     | Search query _(required)_                            |
| -e/--engine    | Provide search engine (default: Google)              |
|                | _(options: Google, Shodan, Bing, Duck, Yahoo, Ask)_  |
| -p/--page      | Specify number of pages (default: 1)                 |
| -H/--header    | Pass custom header to search engine                  |
| -x/--proxy     | Use proxy to surfing                                 |
| -s/--silent    | Silent mode, prints only results in output           |

### Querying

```bash
> go-dork -q "inurl:..."
```

Queries can also be input with stdin

```bash
> cat dorks.txt | go-dork -p 5
```

### Defining engine

Search engine can be changed from the available engines: Google, Shodan, Bing, Duck, Yahoo, Ask.
However, if the `-e` flag is not defined, it will use the Google search engine by default.

```bash
> go-dork -e bing -q ".php?id="
```

This will do a search by the Bing engine.

### Pagination

By default, go-dork scrapes the first page, you can customize using the `-p` flag.

```bash
> go-dork -q "intext:'jira'" -p 5
```

It will search sequentially from pages 1 to 5.

### Adding custom headers

Maybe you want to use a search filter on the Shodan engine, you can use custom headers to add cookies or other header parts.

```bash
> go-dork -q "org:'Target' http.favicon.hash:116323821" \
  --engine shodan -H "Cookie: ..." -H "User-Agent: ..."
```

### Using proxy

Using a proxy, this can also be useful if Google or other engines meet Captcha.

```bash
> go-dork -q "intitle:'BigIP'" -p 2 -x http://127.0.0.1:8989
```

### Chained with other tools

If you want to chain the `go-dork` results with another tool, use the `-s` flag.

```bash
> cat dorks.txt | go-dork | pwntools
> go-dork -q "inurl:'/secure' intext:'jira' site:org" -s | nuclei -t workflows/jira-exploitaiton-workflow.yaml
```
